////////////// Feedback from Kyle

// Just hung out with Kyle and demo'd the output.

// He suggested updating the track to support "Beats on the Seconds. 60 second timer. Not a boring 60 seconds."

// Ideas of generated toward making this player
// Polyphonic to cluster sound rashes
// Against the main melody at a lower volume.
// like

////////////// CYCLE OF FIFTHS

Perfect cycle of fifths
goes down a perfect fifth every time.
goes through all 12 chords on the keyboard (hardly ever used)
C F Bb Eb Ab Db Gb B E A D G C
Diatonic cycle of fifths (major or minor)
popular and classical music
Go down a fifth every time but keep in the major or minor scale you are in.
C minor scale
  C D Eb F G Ab Bb
Diatonic cycle of fifths:
  Cm Fm Bb Eb Ab Ddim G7 Cm
All chords are counting up by thirds

Building triads off of a scale.

Advantage of cycle of fifths

8 bar phrases

    twice at the end
    start with the one chord and end with the 1 cord.

melodic phrase that goes over two chords.
then transpose the phrase over the other chords.

another jazz chord progression
  6 2 5 1

jazz diatonic
  7 chord sequence

extending the cycle of fifths
  patterns.

substitude dominant 7ths with a tritone away
  Cm7, instead of Fdom7, paly a Bdom7
  chromatic moving bass line going down.

final pattern. BEST ONE
  series of 2 5 1s

keeps people's ears captivated for it to resolve.
keeps people listening for the duration of the chord progression.

dave brubeck's take five is an example of this.

// FUTURE PLANNING:

In the future I'd like this player to be able to change keys in the middle of the composition.
