//////////////

    // 7 diatonic triads in any major key
    // Major, Minor, Minor, Major, Major, Minor, Diminished, Major
    // tonic, super tonic, median, sub dominant, dominant, sub median, leading tone, tonic
     // goes down one octave, need to create more notes in the root notes.

////////////// output to mp3

// maybe add in some standard drum beat???

// NEXT STEP: WRITE TO OUTPUT FILE

// command to stop current loop.
// play diffrent song.

// would like to hook this up to the global happiness project.
// global consciousness project.
// feed in random ints from those sensors.
// see what kind of songs those random ints made...

// another idea to make the program listen to popular music to analyze the note structures that got the most virality.
// ... creation of the perfectly derivative pop song.

////////////// Feedback from Kyle

// Just hung out with Kyle and demo'd the output.

// He suggested updating the track to support "Beats on the Seconds. 60 second timer. Not a boring 60 seconds."

// Ideas of generated toward making this player
// Polyphonic to cluster sound rashes
// Against the main melody at a lower volume.
// like
// but with more subtlety?

////////////// CYCLE OF FIFTHS

Perfect cycle of fifths
goes down a perfect fifth every time.
goes through all 12 chords on the keyboard (hardly ever used)
C F Bb Eb Ab Db Gb B E A D G C
Diatonic cycle of fifths (major or minor)
popular and classical music
Go down a fifth every time but keep in the major or minor scale you are in.
C minor scale
  C D Eb F G Ab Bb
Diatonic cycle of fifths:
  Cm Fm Bb Eb Ab Ddim G7 Cm
All chords are counting up by thirds

Building triads off of a scale.

Advantage of cycle of fifths
diatonic is 7 notes in the scale

8 bar phrases
diatonic cycle of fifths is 7 notes
  fills up time
  one chord sustained for each bar.
  double the one chord
    twice at the end
    start with the one chord and end with the 1 cord.

melodic phrase that goes over two chords.
then transpose the phrase over the other chords.

jazz chord progression
  2 5 1
  works in major or minor.

another jazz chord progression
  6 2 5 1

jazz diatonic
  7 chord sequence
  add 7ths 9ths 11ths 13ths
  sounds more harmonically rich

make them sound more interesting
  add notes outside the scale of c minor
  flat ninths

alter your extended notes to get out of the scale

extending the cycle of fifths
  patterns.

substitude dominant 7ths with a tritone away
  Cm7, instead of Fdom7, paly a Bdom7
  chromatic moving bass line going down.

final pattern. BEST ONE
  series of 2 5 1s

keeps people's ears captivated for it to resolve.
keeps people listening for the duration of the chord progression.

dave brubeck's take five is an example of this.

// FUTURE PLANNING:

In the future I'd like this player to be able to change keys in the middle of the composition.
